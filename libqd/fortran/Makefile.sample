# Sample Makefile for compiling Fortran programs using Quad-Double library.
# Make sure the script qd-config (installed during "make install") 
# is in your path.

# Fortran compiler.  Should be whatever  "qd-config --fc"  returns.
FC=$(shell qd-config --fc)

# C++ compiler.  Used for linking.
# Should be whatever  "qd-config --cxx"  returns.
CXX=$(shell qd-config --cxx)

# Fortran compiler flags.  Should be whatever  "qd-config --fcflags"  
# returns, but some items (like optimization levels) # can be 
# tweaked if desired.
FCFLAGS=$(shell qd-config --fcflags)

# Linker flags.  Includes the Quad-Double library and any Fortran
# libraries that needs to be linked in.  Should be whatever  
# "qd-config --fclibs"  returns
FCLIBS=$(shell qd-config --fclibs)

# If your main proram is written in Fortran, you need declare your
# main program as "subroutine f_main", not "program myprog", since
# C++ linker must find the main entry, provided by
# "qd-config --fmainlib".
FCMAIN=$(shell qd-config --fmainlib)
